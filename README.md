# ForageCraft
This mod aims to make survival mode easier by giving various blocks extra drops.

Examples include:
- Carrots and potatoes can be found in grass blocks
- Pumpkin and melon seeds can be found in tall grass
- Ancient bones can be dug up from the dirt
- Leaves now drop some sticks

## Installation
If you would like to install the in-development version of ForageCraft, please follow the following instructions. I advice that you do not "Download as ZIP" as this will not download the .git directory.

### Eclipse
1. Double click on "setup_decomp_workspace_and_eclipse.bat" and let the batch script run.
2. Open Eclipse and change your workspace to the eclipse folder.

### IntelliJ IDEA
1. Double click on "setup_decomp_workspace.bat" and let the batch script run.
2. Open and click on import project.
3. Locate the build.gradle file and open it.
4. No need to configure anything (unless you have a specific gradle home). Click on Finish.
5. Leave IDEA open.
6. Double click on "make_intellij_runs.bat" and let the batch script run.
7. Return to IDEA, and accept the pop-up which asks you to refresh the workspace.
