jei.description.foraging.stick=The best way to get sticks is to go straight to the source and break them off of trees. However, for those of you who would rather hug trees than harm them, nature sometimes does the job for you. Often times, while rooting around in tall grass, you can find old sticks from long dead trees. Of course, not all sticks are of the leafy variety. Sometimes roots found underground are sturdy enough to qualify as sticks.

jei.description.foraging.carrot=For hundreds of years, the testificate race has held a monopoly on carrots, potatoes, beetroots and various other root vegetables. The reason for this is that no one could find any seeds for them. However, one day a smart human put two and two together and realized that, as their name suggests, root veggies are found buried in the soil in nature. Carrots, being roots, are no exception to this, and can sometimes be found in the upper layers of soil while digging.

jei.description.foraging.potato=The potato has been a staple crop of humanity for a very long time. This versatile vegetable, which can be found burried in the topsoil, can be used for dozens of different culinary applications, and is quite healthy. As if that wasn't enough, rumor has it that potatoes have latent electrical properties, and apparently make surprisingly effective projectiles.

jei.description.foraging.toxicpotato=Being root veggies, potatoes tend to absorb stuff from their soil. In areas where the soil contains various harmful substances, such as heavy metals, organic poisons, or political opinions, potato plants tend to build up toxins inside their normally edible roots. The reason for this is unclear. Perhaps it's an evolutionary defense mechanism? Regardless, while such poisonous potatoes are not good for eating, planting them in non toxic areas will ussually result in a crop of good old fashioned non toxic spuds.

jei.description.foraging.beetroot=The beetroot is a mysterious plant, which until recently has been considered little more than myth. A small, red colored root vegetable, the beetroot is unlike other root veggies in that it can't reproduce by just planting peices of it in the ground, like with potatoes. Instead, the beetroot grows from a large, spherical seed. These seeds are supprisingly tough, and can survive for years just lying in the tall grass, until conditions are right for them to take root. Once they do, the seed breaks apart, and the beetroot tunnels into the topsoil. New seeds form in small clusters around the base of the plant, though the relatively small amount of them yeilded by a single plant can make farming difficult. Beetroots are most famous for their use in stew.

jei.description.foraging.bone=Time is a cruel teacher, as all its students die in the end. When they do, their bodies decay until all thats left is their bones, which are eventually buried as nature grinds onwards. These ancient skeletons come in many sizes, from the massive ones left behind by creatures of legend in prehistoric swamplands, to the smaller ones belonging to the more mundane animals of the world, victims of the circle of life. Fortunately for you, these bones are packed with nutrients that plants find tasty. Bone-appetit!

jei.description.foraging.skulls=While digging, you may come across old human skeletons. Who were these people? Were they other people trying to survive, just like you? Were they ancient warriors of story and song? Maybe they are just the remains of the skeletons brought to life every night by dark magic. Each skull has its own story. Think about that as you grind them up into bonemeal.

jei.description.foraging.flint=Sometimes, a rock isn't just an ordinary rock. Flint is a special type of rock that often can be found in stone or gravel, where friction against the surrounding rocks has sharpened them to a point. Traditionally, flint is the material of choice for arrowheads, and its composition means it has uses in fire-starting as well.

jei.description.foraging.goldnugget=Gold is a strange metal. It is widely considered to be a valuable material, yet its practical value is virtually nil. Why is gold held in such high esteem if it is so useless? The answer comes from our ancestors. Humans evolved from a species of sapient pigs, known as the pigmen. These creatures built cities and temples long ago, and their ruins can be seen on the surface to this day. The pigmen were obsessed with gold, which only occurs in small veins or deposits in stone, often then ending up in riverbeds after their stone has been ground away by water. The downfall of pigman kind occured when they discovered how to reach the underworld, through some form of black magic. The underworld has vast veins of gold rich quartz, and no inhabitants to speak of. Or at least, thats what the pigmen thought. But the netherworld is awash with dark energies, and over time the pigmen fell to their influence. Today, they exist only as husks of their former selves, their story lost to time.

jei.description.foraging.diamond=Legend states that diamonds are the remains of the dead, crushed and squeezed until they become unparralleled in sheer strength and beauty. The dwarves were the first to forge armor and weapons from this mighty material, and even though they have since faded from memory, their forging skills live on. To this day, diamonds are coveted as treasures of immeasurable value.

jei.description.foraging.emerald=Emeralds are the most valuable gems in the world, provided you have a big nose and make grunting noises all day. They are often found in deep mountain caverns, and form in very similar ways to diamonds. The most significant source of emeralds today is the testificate mercantile community, which is pretty much all of the greedy little guys. How they got the emeralds in the first place is one of the greatest mysteries of our time.
